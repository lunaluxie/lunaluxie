### 🌟 About Me
I am a **quantum physicsist** and **researcher in computer vision**. But really I am on a life-long adventure trying to learn as much about the world as I can, and experience as many things as I can.

Sometimes, I bottle up my experiences and package them into "little snacks" for others to enjoy.

### 🔬 Research
I focus on the intersection between **Machine Learning** and **Physics**. My core mission is to develop **Responsible and Ethical AI**. 

I am currently exploring ways to ground machine learning models in reality by exploiting physical symmetries. This approach allows for performance guarantees that aren't possible with traditional methods, which is a critical step in ensuring trust and safety in machine learning systems.
